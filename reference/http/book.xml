   The HTTP extension eases handling of HTTP URLs, dates, redirects, 
   headers and messages in a HTTP context (both incoming and outgoing). 
   It also provides means for client negotiation of preferred language 
   and charset, as well as a convenient way to exchange arbitrary data 
   with caching and resuming capabilities.
