  <para>
   Returns an array of statistics collected by the replication
   and load balancing plugin.
  </para>
  <para>
   The PHP configuration setting
   <literal><link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms.collect-statistics">mysqlnd_ms.collect_statistics</link></literal>
   controls the collection of statistics. The collection of statistics
   is disabled by default for performance reasons.
  </para>
  <para>
   The scope of the statistics is the
   <literal>PHP</literal> process.
   Depending on your deployment model a
   <literal>PHP</literal> process may handle one or multiple requests.
  </para>
  <para>
   Statistics are aggregated for all connections and all storage handler. It is not possible
   to tell how much queries originating from
   <literal>mysqli</literal>,
   <literal>PDO_MySQL</literal> or
   <literal>mysql</literal> API calls have
   contributed to the aggregated data values.

         The semantics of this statistic has changed between 1.0.1 - 1.1.0.

       <para>
         The meaning for version 1.0.1 is as follows.
         Number of statements considered as read-only by the built-in query analyzer.
         Neither statements which begin with a SQL hint to force
         use of slave nor statements directed to a slave by an user-defined
         callback are included. The total number of statements sent to the slaves is

         PECL/mysqlnd_ms 1.1.0 introduces a new concept of chained filters. The
         statistics is now set by the internal load balancing filter. With
         version 1.1.0 the load balancing filter is always the last in the
         filter chain, if used. In future versions a load balancing filter may be
         followed by other filters causing another change in the meaning of
         the statistic. If, in the future, a load balancing filter is followed
         by another filter it is no longer guaranteed that the statement, which

       Implicit commit happens, for example, when autocommit has been turned
       off, a query is executed and autocommit is enabled again. In that case,
       the statement will be committed by the server and SQL to maintain is
       injected before the autocommit is re-enabled. Another sequence
       causing an implicit commit is <literal>begin()</literal>,
       <literal>query()</literal>, <literal>begin()</literal>. The second call
       to <literal>begin()</literal> will implicitly commit the transaction
       started by the first call to <literal>begin()</literal>.
       <literal>begin()</literal> refers to internal library calls not actual
